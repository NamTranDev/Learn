Error: Cannot run with sound null safety, because the following dependencies
don't support null safety:

- package:flutter_spinkit

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

Fix : 

First, you should read through the guide to understand unsound null safety. (https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety)
If you are sure that you want to run your app with unsound null safety, you can use the following command:

flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
The --no-sound-null-safety option is not documented in the article, however, I have not experienced any problems with it for the last few months (and especially not since the whole Flutter framework has been migrated to null safety).

Edit: the documentation has now been updated to include this. See Testing or running mixed-version programs. (https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety#testing-or-running-mixed-version-programs)

IDE run args/configuration
To set this up in your IDE of choice, you can use:

IntelliJ/Android Studio: "Edit Configurations" (in your run configurations) â†’ "Additional run args".
VS Code: search for "Flutter run additional args" in your user settings.
In both cases, add --no-sound-null-safety.
